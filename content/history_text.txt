[title]2024 REBRAND[/title]
[text]After 28 years of being called Darlington Rhythm ‘n’ Blues Club we have decided from 1st January 2024 to re-brand our name to DARLINGTON ROCK ‘N’ BLUES CLUB. Darlington R'n'B Club was formed in May 1995 by a small group of blues enthusiasts who decided to do something themselves due to a lack of live rhythm & blues music in Darlington. 

A committee of five people run the R’n’B Club on a voluntary basis and give up a lot of their spare time for events held once a month at the Forum Music Studios in Darlington to function. Events usually attract anywhere between 50 to 100 customers with some R'n'B and Blues fans who probably choose which bands they want to see. 

Spokesman for Darlington R’n’B Club, Mike Prendergast said “Times have changed since we first started back in 1995 and recently, we have noticed a big shift with our customers, especially since the covid epidemic.Some people have stopped coming to gigs, sadly some are no longer with us, and our audience now are a little younger.There is also a change in general with the R’n’B scene in the UK as it has now become more Rock-orientated. We have also noticed that the Rockier bands we promote attract the bigger audiences.However, this is not to say we are about to stop booking our favourite, Blues-based bands that we have grown to love and enjoy over the years, this is just so that we can accommodate a broader feel to the bands we can attract.We hope it won't spoil the experience of attending any of our events and look forward to welcoming back our regulars, and hopefully new customers, to the Forum in 2024 for Darlington Rock ‘n’ Blues Club gigs.”[/text]

[title]RELOCATED TO THE FORUM MUSIC CENTER[/title]
[text]Our events were originally held at Darlington Arts Center which showcased some incredible bands for seventeen years. In the early days of Darlington R’n’B Club, to keep ticket prices down and encourage as many people as possible to attend our gigs, we generated limited runs of souvenir T-shirts and compilation cd’s.

We asked the bands who had played for us if we could use one of their tracks from their cd’s to be included on a compilation of limited-edition cd’s. The first cd was released in 1996 and then every two years after that until 2012, the cd costs were kept low as we thought of them as a nice souvenir for our loyal customers who turned up gig after gig and supported our events.When we moved from Darlington Arts Centre to the Forum Music Centre, if felt like a good time to move on in general. So we stopped releasing cd’s as music had become more accessible online so it just seemed the right time to move our demo tracks online. With cooperation from the bands we have been able to use their tracks as a demo playlist on our website to highlight the quality bands that Darlington R'n'B Club books for their events.[/text]
[title]RNB & RAILWAYS[/title]
[text]Blues origins belong in the deep south of the USA, among the slaves. Once freed these slaves took to the railways for escape, freedom and work. The induction of Sister Rosetta Tharpe's 1939 classic "This Train" into the Grammy Hall of Fame gives an acknowledged link to the “Blues and the Railways.” What better way to celebrate this link than in the home town where the first steam hauled passenger railway journey took place back in 1825.

Some great Blues tunes were inspired by black migrants travelling on trains up to the great northern cities of America looking for a better life. Located only a ten-minute walk from Darlington’s Bank Top Railway Station, Darlington Rhythm ’n’ Blues Club hold their monthly gigs at the Forum Music Centre in Borough Road, Darlington.[/text]
