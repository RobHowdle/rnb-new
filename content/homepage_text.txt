[title]Welcome[/title]
[text]Welcome to Darlington Rock ‘N’ Blues, formerly Rhythm ‘N’ Blues. Born in 1995 by a small group of blues enthusiasts who decided to do something themselves due to a lack of live rhythm & blues music in Darlington. A committee of five people run the R n B Club on a voluntary basis and give up a lot of their spare time for the Club to function.

After 28 years of being called Darlington Rhythm ‘n’ Blues Club, it was decided from 1st January 2024 to re-brand the name to DARLINGTON ROCK ‘N’ BLUES CLUB. We found that times have changed since the club first started back in 1995 and recently, we have noticed a big shift with our customers, especially since the covid epidemic. Some people have stopped coming to gigs, sadly some are no longer with us, and our audience now are a little younger.There is also a change in general with the R’n’B scene in the UK as it has now become more Rock-orientated.
